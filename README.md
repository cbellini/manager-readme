# Chris Bellini's Manager Readme

## Hi! :-)

- What I'm Here To Do For You
  - set context for what we work on
  - help and support you
  - advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company
  - build and refine our team

- What I Won't Do
  - your job
  - tell you how to do your job
    - let me know if I ever do this

## My North Star

- be transparent about what's happened, what's happening, and what's going to happen
- advocate proactive engineering efforts that keep us moving quickly (e.g. writing tests, refactoring legacy code before a new feature, pairing on work to improve our code quality and bus factor)
- promote a culture of continuously fixing things
- assume that everyone has good intentions

## My Communication Style

- Experience has shown me that the vast majority of issues are a result of poor or infrequent communication. It's important we communicate well and often.

## My communication preference (most preferred→ least preferred):

- Face2Face/Zoom → Slack→ Email.
- I sometimes Slack/email outside of business hours if something is fresh in my mind. Unless you're on-call and I flag it as urgent, it can wait until the next business day
- I like fast turnaround and acknowledgement on written communications. I like quick "got it" or "on it" type acknowledgment notes so I know things that we're discussing are moving. If it's an "FYI" there's no need to respond.
- it's impossible to over-communicate. Do not assume I know what you're up to. If you're ever debating including me on a communication, do it.
- I don't process new/complex information in realtime - I am more useful if I can background process it
- I can talk anytime (24x7) if something is urgent - my Outlook calendar is not set in stone
- I strive to give feedback that is:
  - helpful
  - humble
  - immediate
  - in-person / Zoom
  - praise in public / constructive feedback in private

## 1:1s

- I propose a light structure for this meeting but it's primarily focused on your agenda items.
- every two weeks for 30 minutes
  - this can be flexible
- I like using 1:1s to check-in on how you're doing, what you need from me, personnel issues, broad strategy questions discuss, PD
- doesn't have to include status updates if you don't want
- we'll keep track of the topics that we talk about in a OneNote notebook that only you and I have access to
- once a quarter, we'll review your work progress against broader goals that we've established, as well tie them to company initiatives

## Nuance / Errata (aka: people are complicated and I'm no different)

- I make sense of the world around me by viewing it as flow and/or sequence diagrams
- My memory sometimes fails me so I compensate by taking lots of notes
  - Sometimes it takes a while for me to know that I know something until I've had a chance to review my notes
  - If I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.
- I can do "management speak" when applicable, but I default to being candid
- I often use analogies or pop culture references to convey an idea or when I'm looking for validate my understanding of something. If you're not familiar with them or believe them to be inaccurate, let me know in the moment
- If I stray from anything in this document, privately call me out on it
- This document is a living breathing thing and likely incomplete. I will update it frequently and would appreciate your feedback.
